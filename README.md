# PSCore-QuckStart

This project is a quick start for experienced coders new to the PowerShell syntax. Files in the demo are broken into subjects. Each file has extensive comments that explain the concepts.

This project is included in my Pluralsight course "Everyday PowerShell 7 for Developers". See my [About Me](http://arcanecode.me) page for a link to the course.
